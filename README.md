# TV Maze App

Built the app to view the latest episode provided by TV MAZE API. Clicking on an episode takes you to the show page when you can view more information about the show.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Notes

Given more time I would like to implement the following:

### Missing features/funtionality
- Show Page and child test coverage
- Visual Test Coverage (cypress/percy)
- Ability to return to home page
- media queries to support mobile view
- test coverage for average desktop size
- Setup CI for commit tests
- utilised PR and squash commits for cleaner git history
- perfomance improvements around pagination and caching to minimise number of requests to API.
